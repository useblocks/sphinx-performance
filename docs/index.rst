Sphinx-Performance
==================

**Sphinx-Performance** is a Commandline tool to analyse the performance of different Sphinx documentation
project setups.

It was created to answer questions like:

* How well does Sphinx scale?
* What impact does a specific extension have to the build time?
* Is there any different between two specific versions?
* How huge is the benefit of using parallel build mode?
* What are the performance bottlenecks during a Sphinx build?
* What functions have an impact on the runtime?
* Are there any memory problems?

To answer these questions, **two commandline tools** are provided:

sphinx-performance
------------------
Used to create automatically different projects and compare their build time and other key numbers.

See :ref:`sphinx-performance` for details.

sphinx-analysis
---------------
Provides profilers and different viewers for runtime and memory consumption.

See :ref:`sphinx-analysis` for details.

.. note::

   Based on the used test project, **sphinx-performance** may install specific library versions
   into the currently used Python environment.

   It is a good idea to use virtual environments for **sphinx-performance** runs.

-----
This little tool borrows a lot of ideas from the
`performance script <https://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/performance/index.html>`_
of `Sphinx-Needs <https://sphinx-needs.com>`_.
